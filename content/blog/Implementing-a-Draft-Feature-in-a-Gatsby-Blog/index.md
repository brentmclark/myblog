_Hello there, fellow Gatsby blog owner!_
Recently, I've found myself thinking and writing about GatsbyJS. Mostly because, like Bootstrap and React, it's one of the best thing that has happened to me since I started learning front-end development. And now I'm going to share something (not-so-new) I learnt.

When I started out building my portfolio-cum-blog website with Gatsby and actually started writing, I came across an issue. For someone who also writes on [Dev.to](https://dev.to) - where you can start writing out an article, only to _draft_ it and move onto a new one - I got a bit disappointed why uptil now, Gatsby's [blog starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) does not include a built-in functionality of saving drafts and only publishing posts you set as "published", as seen on Dev.to.

>There are other alternatives to this which I found online. Links to them will be listed at the end of this article.

My first thought on how to solve this was looking for the chunk of code that.
